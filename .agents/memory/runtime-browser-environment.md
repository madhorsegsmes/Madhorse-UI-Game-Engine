description: Why regression tests must support the supplied system Chromium in Replit.
---

Use the environment-supplied Chromium for browser regressions in this workspace
when it is available; keep downloaded Playwright Chromium as the portable default
for other machines.

**Why:** The downloaded Chromium headless shell failed before browser startup
because `libglib-2.0.so.0` was unavailable. Replit's supplied Chromium ran the same
runtime checks successfully. A browser launch failure is not a sandbox regression.

**How to apply:** When browser checks fail before their test bodies, distinguish
missing Linux libraries from application failures and preserve the system-browser
override rather than weakening assertions or skipping browser coverage.
